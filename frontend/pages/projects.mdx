### Traffic accidents in Switzerland

> A visual representation of traffic accidents in Switzerland from 2011 to 2021, created to make it easy to understand and interpret patterns and trends in accidents over time. The visualization allows for a deeper understanding of the causes, locations, and severity of accidents, and can be used to inform policy and decision making, as well as raise awareness about road safety in Switzerland.

### Twitter Classification Bot

> A sophisticated bot that uses two pre-trained models to classify tweets on Twitter into four different mood categories: anger, joy, optimism, and sadness. The bot is able to analyze tweets in real-time and provide accurate mood classifications, making it a useful tool for understanding public sentiment on social media platforms.
