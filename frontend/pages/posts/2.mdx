# How to Deploy Plex with Easypanel

import Image from "next/image";

## Step 1 - Create a new project folder

Give it a name for example "plex"

<Image
  src="https://s3.severin.io/blog/images/posts/2_1.webp"
  alt="Create App"
  width={900}
  height={600}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

## Step 2 - Create a new service with "Templates"

Choose the plex template and create the service

  alt="Create App"
  width={900}
  height={600}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

## Step 3 - Edit the settings for the plex service

Go under Environment and add PLEX_CLAIM.
You get the PLEX_CLAIM id from [https://www.plex.tv/claim/](https://www.plex.tv/claim/)
The ID is only valid for 4 minutes, so be fast or generate a new one before deployment.

  width={900}
  height={600}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

```
VERSION=docker
PLEX_CLAIM=claim-XXX
```

## Step 4 - Mounts

That is the location where the media files will be located
You either create a volume mount if you have enough space on your easypanel server or ssh into the easypanel server and connect a external source as a mnt drive

  height={600}
  priority
  className="next-image"
/>

## Step 4 - Deploy and Enjoy

Press deploy and connect to the website
Configure it like every other plex instance
