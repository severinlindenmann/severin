I'm a passionate Data Engineer with a background in Mobility, Data Science, and Economics. I completed my Bachelor's degree in [Mobility, Data Science, and Economics](https://www.hslu.ch/de-ch/wirtschaft/studium/bachelor/mobility) at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. My academic journey has equipped me with a diverse set of skills and a deep understanding of these fields.

Currently, I work as a Data Engineer at [b.telligent](https://www.btelligent.com/), where I develop data warehouse solutions and ETL pipelines using tools like Databricks, Snowflake, Azure, and Fabric. My expertise in Python ensures data reliability and transforms raw data into actionable insights. I collaborate with teams to drive data-driven initiatives and empower organizations to make informed decisions.

In my previous roles, I have contributed significantly to various projects:
- As CTO & Full Stack Developer at [Voicy AG](https://voicy.ch), I developed a web app for self-reflection in organizations using voice messages and AI-based data analysis.
- As CTO & Data Scientist at [Layer](https://layer.swiss), I helped launching Layer.swiss, a spin-off from Oberholzer Digital, focusing on data-driven business solutions for SMEs in the marketing sector.
- As a Consultant at [Oberholzer Digital](https://oberholzerkb.ch), I assisted in implementing data-driven strategies and deploying web analytics tools.
- As an Application Manager at [Screenimage Systems AG](https://screenimage.ch), I led the implementation of digital signage software and developed automation solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring data and creating small side projects. I use tools like Python and React to bring my ideas to life. My passion for learning and my diverse skill set make me a valuable asset to any team.

I am determined to continue growing in my field, using my skills and knowledge to drive innovation and make a positive impact in the industry.
