I am currently a junior data consultant [@OberholzerKB](https://oberholzerkb.ch), where I utilize my skills in data analysis and automation to help the company achieve its goals.
I am also a student at Hochschule Luzern, pursuing my Bachelor degree in [Mobility, Data Science, and Economics](https://www.hslu.ch/de-ch/wirtschaft/studium/bachelor/mobility). My passion for learning and my diverse set of skills make me a valuable asset to any team.

In my free time, I like to explore data and create small side projects. I enjoy using tools like Python and React to bring my ideas to life. I am always looking for new ways to apply my skills and improve my understanding of data and technology. My study of mobility, data science and economics give me a broader perspective on how to use data for the benefit of society.

I am determined to continue to learn and grow in my field, using my skills and knowledge to drive innovation and make a positive impact in the industry.
